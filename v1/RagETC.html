      <blockquote> 
        <p> Every artiste knows that preparation for a concert is almost as stressful 
          as the concert itself. It's not just a question of being fit to sit 
          in stage, a process which takes years of practice (of course , the microwave 
          civilization of these days ensures that the trip from sa ri ga ma to 
          stage is effectuated in less than a year), but the actual moments of 
          getting prepared to leave the house and mount the sabha halls call for 
          tension filled moments when the artiste hopes he has not missed out 
          anything vital. In the case of an &quot;up-coming artiste' it is all 
          the more painful. His inexperience naturally gives rise to a lot of 
          fumbling and fiddling with the odds and ends that make up his 'cutcheri 
          kit'. This, added to the fact that, as an 'up-coming artiste', he has 
          to give himself a few airs to get noticed well enough to be considered 
          for a next chance.<br>
          <br>
          There is of course some vital baggage that he carries with him. Like:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>&Oslash; Tambura<br>
            &Oslash; Tambura artiste (if it happens to be a wife)<br>
            &Oslash; Flask<br>
            &Oslash; Hot water (steam actually visible)<br>
            &Oslash; Note book (usually in plural), otherwise, masses and masses 
            of written sheets <br>
            &Oslash; Bio-data and photos (one overflowing bag will do)<br>
            &Oslash; Strepsils (cloves do just as well)<br>
            &Oslash; Handkerchief (for wiping away perspiration)<br>
            &Oslash; Hand towel (on which to slap the hand while performing the 
            'thala operation'<br>
            And the list goes on&#133;&#133;&#133;..</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Among these vital accessories, there may be others that the vocalist 
        can think of that will make the stay on the platform less uncomfortable. 
        A few&#133;..</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><br>
          &Oslash; <b>Cotton wool</b> - presumably for protection against the 
          Margazhi air, but actually protecting his ear drums from the assaults 
          of the accompanist.<br>
          &Oslash; <b>A tooth whitener</b> - to create a better impression when 
          smiling at VIPs in front<br>
          &Oslash; <b>Digital diary</b> - to display, the lists of 'spontaneous' 
          kanakkus and 'on the spot' swaras that he has been by-hearting for the 
          past two months but still forgets from time to time<br>
          &Oslash; <b>A pair of dark glasses</b> - too bad that he seems to have 
          the 'Madras Eye' - but actually to prevent the audience from seeing 
          him glare at the violinist when the latter makes a mistake<br>
          &Oslash; <b>Wall clock (on the wrist)</b> - a 'fashion' he says, but 
          in effect, to display the time so clearly that the violinist knows when 
          he is overstepping the time limit in his solos<br>
          &Oslash; <b>Iodex</b> - to nurse hid injured limbs after acrobatic display 
          (especially when touching the higher notes)<br>
          &Oslash; <b>Gong</b> - to wake up the sleeping member at the back<br>
          &Oslash; <b>A pair of spectacles</b> - specially constructed to give 
          double vision - Makes the artiste see double the number of rasikas present, 
          thus boosting his morale at the 'large' audience turnout<br>
          &Oslash; <b>Automatic de amplifier</b> - to muffle out the apaswarams<br>
          &Oslash; <b>Automatic 'clappometer'</b> - that is switched on when the 
          audience remains meaningfully silent after an item<br>
          &Oslash; <b>One 'clap-boy'</b> - to discreetly activate the above<br>
          &Oslash; Automatic '<b>thalometer</b>' to help him keep him correct 
          beat at the tani avarthanam (of course, for his own renderings)<br>
          &Oslash; <b>Sruti malika tambura</b> - that fluctuates pitch faithfully 
          according to the vocalist's fluctuations<br>
          &Oslash; <b>A posse of young cousins</b> - to queue up and look like 
          autograph hunters at the end<br>
          &Oslash; <b>A battery of reputed vidwans</b> - whose presence raises 
          his value a hundred fold</p>
        <p>And finally&#133;&#133;&#133;<br>
          &Oslash; <b>A strong mix of cement and fevicol</b> - to plant him back 
          to earth after his performance<br>
          <br>
