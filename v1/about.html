        Ramaswamy is a seasoned and well known musician who has been performing

        Music - the classical music of South India.</font></b></P>
      <P align="justify" Ttyle="color:#600000">Maragatham Ramaswamy was formally 
        educated and trained in Carnatic music as a vocalist and a violinist.<br>
        Earning the title of Sangeetha Vidhwan at an early age in these two pursuits, 
        she has performed at<br>
        prestigeous sabhas in Madras and at All India Radio, Madras before she 
        moved to the United States in the<br>
        1980s with her family.</P>
      <P align="justify" Ttyle="color:#600000">Her reputation in Madras preceded 
        her arrival in Northern Virigina. She was approached by many interested<br>
        students and parents for assistance in learning Carnatic music. She responded 
        because of her love for<br>
        teaching. She saw this as an opportunity to inculcate a love for Carnatic 
        music in young minds and hearts.<br>
        Very soon her love of teaching overtook her own aspirations as an individual 
        performer.</P>

            lovingly put together by her devoted students. This website was first 
            launched during the 15th anniversary of Ragamalika as a tribute to 
            a great guru and an active and lively musical organization that she
