<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Students and Parents,  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am very excited that the date for our annual day program has been finalized. Please keep <strong>May 24, 2008 </strong> free. You have worked very hard this year and I am eagerly looking forward to showcasing all your talents at the recital. Details regarding the music program will follow. This is a preliminary notification so you can mark the date on your calendar. I sincerely hope each and every one of my students will be able to attend. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For reasons beyond my control we have not had a student recital for two years now and I was determined not to let another year go by without one. Finding a convenient date for the annual day program turned out to be harder than initially anticipated. I wanted to make sure that it did not clash with Nadatarangini, AP exams, SAT exams, high school graduations, and school finals so our students and accompanying artists would be able to participate. I had hoped to avoid the Memorial Day weekend but was unable to do so because of all these constraints. I realize that some of you may have plans for that weekend. I sincerely hope that I have given you sufficient notice that you can work this event into your plans. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The annual day program will be held at <strong>SRI SIVA VISHNU TEMPLE AUDITORIUM </strong>. Please feel free to invite your family and friends to this program and help make it a grand success! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regards, </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Preparations for the annual day program are in full swing. I have been working with my students to select songs for the program and most of you know what you will be singing. The program will consist of group presentations and for the most part you will perform with other students who take lessons with you. In addition, there will be two larger group presentations: (i) Pancharatna Kriti &quot;Endharo Mahanubhauvulu&quot; and (ii) Bilahari Thillana. Anyone who has learnt either song from me is welcome to participate. Please review the attached song list and call me ASAP if you do not find your name or have a question about the song assigned to your group. Participant names will appear on the program notes as shown in the attachment. Please take a moment to validate your child&rsquo;s name. Submit any corrections to raagamalika02@yahoo.com</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please send an email to raagamalika02@yahoo.com no later than May 5th, 2008 if you are able to participate.</font></p>
